# AIS
AIS library for arduino

Library makes it possible to decode the content of the AIVDM messages

See http://www.bosunsmate.org/ais/ for information about AIVDM
This page is not correct in the example where MMSI is decoded though.

Also see http://catb.org/gpsd/AIVDM.html for message info.

A couple of online decoders:
